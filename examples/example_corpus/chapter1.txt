Jamie stared out of the classroom window as gray clouds rolled over the hills. The science lesson hummed in the background, but her thoughts followed the distant flash of lightning. She wondered whether the weather would ruin the after-school soccer game that she had promised to captain. Coach always told the team that storms could be friends or foes, and Jamie was determined to prove that she could adapt no matter what arrived on the wind.

If it stayed, they would move the fun inside and build cardboard forts for the younger students. The idea lit up every face at the table. Jamie wrote the plan neatly in her notebook so that everyone knew what to do. Even if the thunder rumbled all afternoon, they would still have a story to tell.
