Jamie looked out the classroom window as gray clouds moved over the hills. The science lesson went on quietly, but she kept thinking about the lightning far away. She wondered if the weather would stop the after-school soccer game she was supposed to lead. Coach always said storms could be good or bad, and Jamie wanted to show she could handle whatever the wind brought.

At lunch, she got her friends together to make a plan. If the storm went away, they would play a quick soccer game. If the storm stayed, they would have fun inside by building cardboard forts for the younger kids. Everyone at the table smiled at the idea. Jamie wrote the plan carefully in her notebook so everyone would know what to do. Even if the thunder kept going all afternoon, they would still have a fun story to tell.
